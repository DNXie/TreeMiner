# TreeMiner Algorithm

Treeminer uses the vertical scope-list representation to mine frequent sequences [2005-treeminer:tkde]. 
Treeminer counts all embeddings, whereas Treeminer-D counts only distinct occurrences, 
which can be more appropriate for some datasets. Also included is the
horizontal format based PatternMatcher approach.
